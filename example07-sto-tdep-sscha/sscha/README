Steps:

1. create folder phonon-not-xml, contains prefix.dyn{i}, DFPT results but with conventional QE file format

1. Run the following scripts

	1-sscha-generate.py  
	2.1-config-submit-gpu-nersc.slurm
	2.2-config-submit-gpu-nersc.slurm
    3-sscha-collect.py
    4-sscha-minimize.py

2. Create a new "phonon" folder but with sscha xml files
   5-new-phonon-folder.sh

3. In qe2pert.x calculations, link phdir to the current "phonon/save" directory instead


Note: some of the outputs are omitted in this folder. This folder is just an example.
