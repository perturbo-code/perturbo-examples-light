Steps to run TDEP calculations with scripts: 

1. Change the directories in collect.sh and submit.sh to where the folder is

2. Create supercell (in this example it is 4*4*4, diagonal) 
   Generate canonical configurations using -of 1 (outputs are in VASP format, named contcar_conf000X)

3. Run contcar_to_qe.py to convert to qe_conf000X suitable for QE inputs. You can also convert the files yourself.

4. Create scf0 folder, move qe_conf000X to scf0.
   Copy scripts submit.sh submit.slurm and collect.sh into scf0.

5. Run submit.sh to create qe_conf000X.in based on scf_ref.in, as scf.in input files, and job submission scirpts based on submit.slurm

6. Run collect.sh after all jobs are done to collect infile forces and positions

7. Come back to the main page, create infile.meta, infile.stat, infile.lotosplitting (tutorials for creating lotosplitting from QE/ph.out can be found on TDEP official webiste)

8. Run extract_forceconstant and phonon_dispersion_relation

9. Repeat the above loop for scf1, scf2, ...
